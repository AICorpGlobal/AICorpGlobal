AICORP : Functional-Project Matrix

This hybrid structure combines the stability and efficiency of a functional structure with the flexibility and focus of a project-based structure. While there's no direct dual reporting, project managers report to functional managers, ensuring alignment with the organization's overall strategy.

Key Characteristics:

- Strong Functional Departments: Well-defined functional departments (e.g., engineering, marketing, finance) maintain core competencies and provide support to projects.

- Project-Based Teams: **Cross-functional teams** are formed for specific projects, drawing talent from different departments.

- Functional Manager Oversight: **Functional managers oversee both the day-to-day operations** of their departments and the performance of team members on projects.

- Project Manager Leadership: Project managers lead project teams, define project goals, and track progress.

- Minimal Meetings, Maximum Efficiency: A lean approach to meetings, focusing on key decision points and progress reviews.

- Written Communication: Clear and concise written communication, including project plans, status reports, and design documents.
