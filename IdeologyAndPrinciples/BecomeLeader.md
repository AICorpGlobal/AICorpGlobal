# Leaders of the World

Copied from Islamic Leadership - 

Good leaders often possess exemplary leadership characteristics like honesty, integrity, righteousness chivalry etc.

   However, each leader also possesses some unique characteristics that set them apart. Here are the things the above leaders had in common. 

## Having a Great Vision

Take the example of any great Muslim leader in history, and you would see all of them having a dynamic and great vision at the start.
Similarly, Hazrat Umer R. wanted to conquer as many lands in the vicinity of Makkah and beyond as possible. Without the right vision, these leaders would not have known where to star## 

## Skills to Match the Vision

Leadership Skills to Match the Vision

History notes that all leaders who were able to leave a mark in history had exemplary leadership skills. They were physically and mentally fit to take on the hard challenges. This is integral because when leaders lack skill themselves, like, in the case of the later Mughal emperors, the empire soon ceases to exist. 

the other hand, leaders like Muhammad bin Qasim were excellent swordsmen and military strategists, which is why they were able to achieve their full potential.

## Ability to Adapt to Change

No matter how hard you try or how much you plan, some things never go your way, eg: blackswan events. In todayâ€™s world, these could be external circumstances like a lockdown, a financial breakdown, or a family emergency. Great leadership knows how to handle change. 
Take the example of Prophet Muhammad and the treaty of Hudaibiyah. Although the prophet wanted to perform a pilgrimage that year, he decided to change his decision to avoid a possible clash with the Makkans.

## Knowing When to Give Up

Resilience, coupled with strength and an optimistic attitude, is great. However, most leaders show resilience in the face of unrealistic dreams. One of the best qualities of a great leader is that they know when to stop.
Leaders who become greedy and go too far in the pursuit of greatness often end up losing a lot, in some cases: even their lives. As a modern Muslim leader, you should dream realistically and set up small and achievable goals.

## Accepting Defeat Gracefully

No one likes to lose, especially not a leader who has to answer to a huge army or an entire country. However, when the stakes are high and the competition is strong, there is always a chance that you might not lose. 

Take the example of great conquers and leaders like Tariq Bin Ziyad and Timur. They were not undefeated in battle. Although they won more times than they lose, they did not sit back and whine. Rather, they accepted their defeat gracefully.

## Learning From the Mistakes

Leaders Learning From the Mistakes

You can fight the same battles, literally or metaphorically, a thousand times and still get the same result unless you sit back and ponder over what you did wrong. An attribute that was common in all leaders in history was that they were highly perceptive. 

After a defeat or a setback, they used to consult their trusted court men and governors and take their advice on important matters. Their inclusive leadership style helped them get ahead in the game and not repeat the mistakes they once made. 

## High Moral and Ethical Standards

The current leadership of the world may have forgotten morality or ethics. However, leaders of the past, especially, great Muslim leaders like the righteous caliphs, had very high moral and ethical standards for themselves and all the people they appointed. 

For example, Hazrat Ali R.A. is reported to hold all his governors accountable for any financial mishap. This helped ensure equality within the Muslim kingdoms. Additionally, this helped inspire others to act more righteously.
