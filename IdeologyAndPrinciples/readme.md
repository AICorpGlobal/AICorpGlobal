# Why
A Company/Organization in Economics  is treated as an Individual. 
I believe this Individual needs to represent the collective of the people who work. 
But for people to gather together they need a cause and purpose without which it will submerge into chaos.
As for any good society its s blend of Order and Chaos at its balance.

For AICORP I wish the company to abide and have set of core values . 
Since when I write this , I would like to start with the most active topic that is Oppression

While writing I don't want to keep distingushing between women and men. so I might keep using man or he even if it applies to women. 

**Before Start fighting for any cause, keep in mid about this warning âš  - One might become the very same evil that he fought against**

We stand against Oppressor at all times and will keep a watch to not become one. 
We ecourage you to keep order at all times and the same time disobey orders when you feel that order or request is not the right thing to do for you as a person or the company as it want to represent. The key point is that one should be righteous first. 
Every Employee or A person with whom we interact should have the freedom of experresion which he should exercise with required caution and care for others.
Righteousness and Courage is of utmost importance to us. even if that means we are going to fail. 
Like every system AICORP might also fail someday. but when it fails we should be able to say that it failed by standing for the right thing and doing the right thing.

We only employ people for there skill or time, will never ask them to sell  there souls. At the same time we will try to work with people who believe in the same thing and similar values.
Discuss and debate everything inside the company but keep discussions constructive, for us Humans these discussions matter a lot and will improve our understanding. 

Crafting a Leader to lead the company might be the hardest of hardest as I know it is not something simple that some board members can decide, experiment and rotate at will . 
I wish he should have the right values vision and the courage to drive the company.Acceptance of Employees is of utmost importance.
Never for profit ditch the staff, perfromance evaluation or journey path differences should be the only reason to let someone go.

A leader is a leader if and only if there are followers, the basic thing that a leader should provide is protection from external threats and the follower should provide in return loyalty/commitment and valour to stick with the righteous vision of the leader.

For now when everyone call to stand with something or someone. 

I call to Stand with Palestine.

Everyone one should be able to pray at Jerusalem and the nation need to be united under one glorious righteous Leader.
